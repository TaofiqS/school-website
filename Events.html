        <h3>Apply for the Women's Bond Club Scholarship worth $40K</h3>
        <p>
          Apply by the 25th of March
          The Women's Bond Club Scholarship was established to assist young women pursuing careers in business, technology and finance in a Wall Street firm, bank, or service provider.  The award is a $10,000 renewable scholarship, along with a mandatory mentoring program and internship possibilities.

          It is a really fantastic opportunity for young women pursuing this career trajectory; I had the pleasure of working with several winners during my time at another NYC high school.  Stuy students first became eligible to compete for this award three years ago, and we have had winners each of those years!  This is a scholarship eligible students should not ignore.
